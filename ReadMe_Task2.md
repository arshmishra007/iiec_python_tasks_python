Here i created a web application named eduzor which will accept the client username , password , and the command he wants to run on a remote redhat OS . 
once details are entered , they are send via get request to the server .
the server fetches the requests , seperates the fields .
once the fields are seperated it is verified wether the person is authorised , if yes then the command runs and the output is printed , if not then not a correct user is returned.
